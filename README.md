API group project: Dota 2 Hero Database

We created a simple hero data base for the globally popular game Dota2
This game is one of the biggest names in eSports, and is played professionally worldwide.
The 2017 International tournament offered a prize pool of $24 million
We wanted to create an information hub for all relevant Dota2 information. 
As of now we have the page being populated by icons for all of the 115 heroes in the game pulled from the Dota2 API

When you click on a hero it displays a photo and some basic stats from the API

At the same time we're searching the Youtube API for game play on the hero.

This is very basic as of now, but we have talked about updating it with more useful information such as profressional team line ups with information on each player. This could include the heros they tend to play and stats on their success with that hero. We could have information on their current team matchup and any previous games vs that team. Basically we could include any information that you would in a physical sport.
I would like to add a tournament standing bracket during tournament time.
And most importantly I would like to update the hero information being displayed to something more useful than the basic starting starts we have currently. I could also narrow down the youtube search to something more specific. As of now we have our code pulling the hero name from the dota2 api and plugging that into the youtube search.
